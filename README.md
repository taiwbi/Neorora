# Neorora: AstroNvim Configuration

This is my personal AstroNvim configuration, Neorora, meticulously crafted for an enhanced coding experience in **Python**, **PHP** (with a focus on **WordPress** and **Laravel**), **Rust**, and **Web Development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript). It's designed to be both functional and visually appealing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Backup Existing Neovim Configuration (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
   mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
   mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak
   mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak
   ```

2. **Fork or Clone:**

   - **Fork (Recommended):** Click the "Fork" button on the top right of this repository page to create your own copy. This allows you to track your changes.
   - **Clone (Alternative):** If you don't need to track changes through GitHub, you can clone directly.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   These are the dependencies based on the provided configuration. You might need to adjust these based on the features you intend to use.

   **Fedora Linux (using `dnf`):**

   ```bash
   # Neovim, Git, Node.js, npm
   sudo dnf install -y neovim git nodejs npm
   # PHP, Composer, required PHP extensions
   sudo dnf install -y php php-cli php-common php-mbstring php-xml php-zip composer
   # Build tools (compiler, linker, etc.)
   sudo dnf install -y make cmake gcc gcc-c++
   # Rust
   sudo dnf install -y rustup
   # Python and other development packages
   sudo dnf install -y python3 python3-pip

   # Required for rust development
   rustup-init
   rustup component add rustfmt

   # Required for Python debugging
   pip install debugpy

   # (Optional) Required by image.nvim
   sudo dnf install -y ImageMagick ImageMagick-devel luarocks
   luarocks --local --lua-version=5.1 install magick
   ```

   **Other Distributions:** Adapt the above commands using your distribution's package manager (e.g., `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu, `pacman` for Arch Linux).

4. **Clone Your Fork (or the Repository):**

   ```bash
   # If you forked:
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_fork_name>.git ~/.config/nvim

   # If you cloned directly:
   git clone https://github.com/taiwbi/neorora.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

### Launch Neovim

Open Neovim, and AstroNvim will automatically install and configure the plugins using `lazy.nvim`:

```bash
nvim
```

You should see a welcome screen (Alpha dashboard) with the 2B image (if you're using Kitty or Ghostty) or the ASCII art.

## üöÄ Post-Installation

1. **Intelephense License (Optional):**

   - If you have an Intelephense license, add it to `lua/plugins/astrolsp.lua` in the `intelephense` section:
     ```lua
     init_options = {
       licenceKey = "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE",
     },
     ```

2. **Configure AI Tools:**

   - Refer to the documentation of `codecompanion.nvim` and `minuet-ai.nvim` for any necessary API key setup or configuration.
   - Currently, the config uses DeepInfra endpoints and requires a `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY` env variable. You can put this key in a file at `~/.ssh/keys/deepinfa-key`. You need both.

3. **Explore and Customize:**
   - Familiarize yourself with AstroNvim's mappings and commands. Use `:help` to access documentation.
   - Customize further by editing the files in `lua/plugins/`.

## ü§ù Contributing

Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes. I really haven't got the time to test the installation process, it should work but still might not! If you encounter any issues during the setup or have any questions, feel free to ask in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/taiwbi/Neorora/issues).

## üéâ Enjoy!

Happy coding with your new and improved AstroNvim setup!
